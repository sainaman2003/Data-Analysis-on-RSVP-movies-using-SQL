# Data Analysis on RSVP movies using SQL

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. The company has generally released movies for the Indian audience, but they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The aim of the project is to analysis the data using SQL and get some interesting insights out of the data and decide whether RSVP should release movie globally or not. If yes than what kind of movie should RSVP release. We are going to answer this kind of question in this project by analysing the data.
